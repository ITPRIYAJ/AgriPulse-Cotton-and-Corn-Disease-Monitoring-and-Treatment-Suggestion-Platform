# 🌾 AgriPulse: Cotton and Corn Disease Monitoring and Treatment Suggestion Platform
📌 Project Overview
AgriPulse is an intelligent crop health management platform that leverages Machine Learning and Computer Vision to detect diseases in cotton and corn crops through image analysis and provides personalized treatment suggestions to farmers. This system aims to reduce crop loss, improve yield quality, and empower farmers with smart agricultural practices.

🚀 Features
📸 Image-Based Disease Detection

🔍 Real-Time Monitoring of Crop Health

🧠 ML-Driven Classification of Common Cotton and Corn Diseases

💊 Automated Treatment Recommendations (Pesticides, Organic Remedies, etc.)

📱 User-Friendly Interface (Web or Mobile-based)

🌐 Multilingual Support (Optional)

🛰️ Integration with IoT Sensors (Optional for Future Enhancements)
